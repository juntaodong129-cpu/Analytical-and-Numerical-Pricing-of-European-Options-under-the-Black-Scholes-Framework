# Analytical-and-Numerical-Pricing-of-European-Options-under-the-Black-Scholes-Framework

This project implements analytical and numerical methods for pricing European options
under the Black–Scholes framework.

The Black–Scholes closed-form formula is used as a reference solution.
Numerical methods include finite-difference schemes for the transformed heat equation
(explicit, implicit and Crank–Nicolson θ-schemes) and the CRR binomial tree model.

The project focuses on numerical accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis.
Errors are studied with respect to grid resolution and time discretization,
with particular attention to behavior near the strike price.
